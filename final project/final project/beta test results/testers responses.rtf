\f0\fs24 \cf0 1.) How easy is it to play this game?\
It is pretty easy to play this game. The controls are simples and the directions are simple enough.\
\
2.)How much would you pay for this game?\
I would not pay too much for this game because it is quite simple and doesn\'92t really match up to other games. I would pay $1-2 for this game only if there are more levels and rooms added.\
\
3.)What thematic elements are provided and what does not fit?\
The theme of the map is very bland as of now. It would be cool to add textures to the walls and floors if possible. That would make the game more appealing to look at.\
\
4.)What audience would this game reach?\
The audience this would reach would probably be children on the younger side who are just starting out with videogames. It would be a good starter game for them to try and figure out simple controls and puzzles.\
