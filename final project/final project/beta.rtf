\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 I had three testers play the game in its current state. One of them likes playing video games and knew what to expect when playing the game. The other two haven't really played and are just beginning so it took them a little while to figure out the gist of the game. This game could be played by anyone, no matter what experience they have with games. I think the feedback that I would get is that the setting of the game is a bit boring, which I will be working on putting textures into the floor and walls to give it a pleasing view.}
